# 📊 Coca-Cola Enterprise Sales Performance & Profitability Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes sales performance and profitability trends using a Coca-Cola enterprise dataset obtained from **Emperor Data Analytics (hosted by Fatolu Peter)**.

The goal of this project was not just to report revenue numbers, but to uncover strategic insights that can help drive smarter business decisions.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Although total revenue appeared strong, the business needed deeper answers to important questions:

- Are we increasing profit or just increasing sales volume?
- Which regions contribute the most revenue?
- Is the business overly dependent on a specific region?
- Which products generate high sales but lower profit margins?
- How balanced is performance across sales representatives?
- Are there noticeable seasonal trends?

This project aims to answer these questions through structured data analysis and visualization.
